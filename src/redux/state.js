        title: "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead",
        dialogue: "Do you ever think of yourself as actually dead, lying in a box with the lid on it? Nor do I really. Silly to be depressed by it. I mean, one thinks of it like being alive in a box. One keeps forgetting to take into account that one is dead. Which should make all the difference. Shouldn't it? I mean, you’d never know you were in a box would you? It would be just like you were asleep in a box. Not that I’d like to sleep in a box, mind you. Not without any air. You'd wake up dead for a start and then where would you be? In a box. That's the bit I don't like, frankly. That’s why I don’t think of it. Because you'd be helpless wouldn't you? Stuffed in a box like that. I mean, you'd be in there forever. Even taking into account the fact that you're dead. It isn't a pleasant thought. Especially if you're dead, really. Ask yourself: if I asked you straight off I'm going to stuff you in this box now – would you rather to be alive or dead? Naturally you’d prefer to be alive. Life in a box is better than no life at all. I expect. You'd have a chance at least. You could lie there thinking, well, at least I’m not dead. In a minute, somebody’s going to bang on the lid and tell me to come out. (knocks) Hey you! What's your name? Come out of there!",

        dialogue: "Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; / And now I’ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven; / And so am I revenged. That would be scann’d: / A villain kills my father; and for that, / I, his sole son, do this same villain send / To heaven. / O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. / He took my father grossly, full of bread; / With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; / And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? / But in our circumstance and course of thought, / ‘Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, / To take him in the purging of his soul, / When he is fit and season’d for his passage? / No! / Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: / When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, / Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; / At gaming, swearing, or about some act / That has no relish of salvation in’t; / Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, / And that his soul may be as damn’d and black / As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: / This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.",

        dialogue: "Now hear this, Willy, this is me. You know why I had no address for three months? I stole a suit in Kansas City and I was in jail. I stole myself out of every good job since high school! And I never got anywhere because you blew me so full of hot air I could never stand taking orders from anybody! That’s whose fault it is! It’s goddam time you heard this! I had to be big boss shot in two weeks, and I’m through with it! Willy! I ran down eleven flights with a pen in my hand today. And suddenly I stopped, you hear me? And in the middle of that office building, do you hear this? I stopped in the middle of that building and I saw—the sky. I saw the things that I love in this world. The work and the food and time to sit and smoke. And I looked at the pen and said to myself, what the hell am I grabbing this for? Why am I trying to become what I don’t want to be? What am I doing in an office, making a contemptuous, begging fool of myself, when all I want is out there, waiting for me the minute I say I know who I am!",

        dialogue: " Lie Number One: All this squeamishness she puts on! You should just know the line she's been feeding to Mitch--He thought she had never been more than kissed by a fellow!  But Sister Blanche is no lily!   Our supply-man down at the plant has been going through Laurel for years and he knows all about her and everybody else in the town of Laurel knows all about her.   She is as famous in Laurel as if she was the President of the United States, only she is not respected by any party!   This supply-man stops at a hotel called the Flamingo.  She’s stayed there too. This is after the home-place had slipped through her lily white fingers!  She moved to the Flamingo!  A second class hotel which has the advantage of not interfering in the private social life of the personalities there!  The Flamingo is used to all kinds of goings-on.  But even the management of the Flamingo was impressed by Dame Blanche!  In fact they were so impressed by Dame Blanche that they requested her to turn in her room-key--for permanently!  This happened a couple of weeks before she showed here.  Sure, I can see how you would be upset by this. She pulled the wool over your eyes as much as Mitch's!",

        dialogue: "Now, I have a theory that everybody’s got a nice grandmother and a mean, evil, insane one. And I was always afraid that if they ever touched, their converse powers would mutually annihilate each other. I was eight when I first learned which was which. I was at a family barbecue with forty or fifty of my cousins carpooling on one hibachi. And my gramps was there on his life support system. We were keeping him alive against his will. Because my pops wanted him to live long enough so he would suffer what he had made my pops suffer. He would always motion me over, then he’d be like…Pull the plug. No one’s looking, John, pull the plug! But, abuelito, you know I’m not supposed to touch your iron lung… Just do it. Just do it. Mother@#$%*! Okay, Goodbye, Gramps. I’d give him a kiss, then pull the plug. But my dad had an uncanny ability to sense my grandfather escaping. He’d rush over just in time… Hey, you know you’re not supposed to put your grandfather out of his misery. Then he’d plug him back in. Nice try, old man.",
